    <h4>Lionel Messi was born, 24 June 1987, in Rosario, Argentina to a working-class family. His father was a factory steel worker, and his mother a cleaner.
He began playing from an early age, and his talent was soon apparent. However, at the age of 11, Messi was diagnosed with growth hormone deficiency (GHD).<br>
His local club, River Plate were interested in signing Messi but did not want to pay for his medical treatment. However, Messi was given a trial with Barcelona, and coach Carles Rexach was impressed  offering Messi a contract  which included paying for his treatment in Spain.<br>
Messi progressed through the ranks and was given his first appearance in the 2004/05 season becoming the youngest player to score a league goal. <br>
In the 2009-10 season, Messi scored 47 goals in all competitions, equalling Ronaldo's record total for Barcelona<br>
In the calendar year of 2012, he broke the all-time world record for most goals scored in a calendar year<br>
After a disappointing first game, when Argentina unexpectedly lost to Saudi Arabia, Lionel Messi was key to firing Argentina to a 2-0 victory over Mexico, with Messi scoring an excellent goal.<br>
With all these accomplishments it's clear why messi is regarded as the greatest footballer of all time.
